# Dungeon Locked

## üìñ Game Overview
__Dungeon Locked__ is a local co-op game inspired by the 00's Flash classic "Fireboy and Watergirl".  

In this game, two players take on the roles of our main characters, Lavena and Tergon, as they navigate through challenging dungeons filled with traps and enemies. To finally achieve freedom, they have to advance through 3 levels that require teamwork and strategy to overcome.  

In each level, the difficulty increases, introducing new challenges. In the final level, you'll face all the obstacles from the previous levels, along with a surprising new challenge that will push your abilities to the limit.

### Levels

In every level, the players' primary objective is to gather two keys that unlock the gate (black line), allowing them to progress to the next stage.
Each player can only pick up the key that matches their color, which enables the creation of more entertaining and challenging puzzles.
New levels gradually introduce new features, like:
* Environmental Obstacles: Toxic Lakes, platforms and walls.

* Enemies: Skeleton and Final Boss Skeleton.

* Traps and challenges: Toxic ponds and button-coordenated walls.

### Level 1 (Tutorial)

Basic layout and terrain to familiarize players with teamwork mechanics.

* Introduce the players to the key feature
All of these features allow the new players to get familiar with the controls, mechanics and objectives of the game.

### Level 2

Features new enemies, platforms and toxic ponds.

This level includes:
* More challenging parkour sections;
* Toxic ponds (which can only be touched by the character of the matching color);
* A new enemy, the skeleton, which moves exclusively sideways.
* Deaths: If the wrong player touches the toxic pond or any of them comes in contact with the monster, they will die instantly and respawn at the initial position.

### Level 3
Introduced new button obstacles and a bigger boss enemy.
